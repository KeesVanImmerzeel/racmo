Description: Provides functions to download and read NetCDF files from the KNMI Data Platform
    (<https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/dataset/knmi23-droogtestatistiek-1-0>), which contain
    meteorological data from RACMOv2.3 used for STOWA drought statistics. The package
    converts these files into projected 'terra' SpatRaster stacks with time-based layer names
    for further spatial analysis and visualization.
